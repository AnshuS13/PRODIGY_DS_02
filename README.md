# Titanic Data Analysis

This project is part of my data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal is to analyze the Titanic dataset to understand factors influencing passenger survival.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers, including demographic details, ticket class, and whether they survived.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Project Overview

1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering)  
3. Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
4. Model building using Logistic Regression  
5. Model evaluation and interpretation  
6. Saving the trained model

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook (`titanic_analysis.ipynb`) to explore the step-by-step analysis.  
- Run the Python script (`titanic_analysis.py`) for automated execution of data processing and modeling.  
- The trained logistic regression model is saved as `titanic_logistic_model.pkl`.

## Results

- Achieved around 80% accuracy in predicting passenger survival.  
- Visualizations reveal survival trends based on age groups, fare bands, and family categories.
